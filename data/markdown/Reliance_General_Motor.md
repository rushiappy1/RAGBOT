**UIN No.: IRDAN103RP0010V02100001/A0050V01202223**


**1. DEFINITIONS**


1.1 **Battery (EVB)**


Means an electric vehicle battery (EVB) (also known as
‘traction battery’) used to power the electric motors of
a battery electric vehicle (BEV) or hybrid electric vehicle
(HEV). These batteries are rechargeable batteries and
are typically the Lithium-Ion batteries. These batteries are
specifically designed for a high ampere-hour (or Kilowatthour) capacity. Electric vehicle batteries differ from starting,
lighting and ignition (SLI) batteries as they are designed
to go give power over sustained periods of time and are
deep-cycle batteries.


1.2 **Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)**


A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), a pure electric vehicle, only
electric vehicle, fully electric vehicle or all electric vehicle
is a type of electric vehicle that exclusively uses chemical
energy stored in rechargeable battery packs, with no
secondary source of propulsion (e.g. hydrogen fuel cell,
internal combustion engine, etc.) Battery Electric Vehicle
derive all power from battery packs and thus have no
internal combustion engine, or fuel tank.


1.3. **Battery Management System (BMS)**


A Battery Management System (BMS) is an electronic
system that manages EVB, such as by protecting the
battery from operating outside its safe operating area,
monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting
that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and
/ or balancing it.


The BMS also controls the charging and discharging, as well
as recharging of the battery by redirecting the recovered
energy (i.e., from regenerative braking) back into the EVB.
Inverter, converter and the cooling systems also form part
of the BMS.


For the purposes of this Policy, it means the original BMS
provided by the Manufacturer along with new purchase
of the Vehicle without any modifications, or the original
BMS that has been replaced by the original equipment
manufacturer following some fortuitous event.


1.4. **Electric Motor and Differential**


Means the core component of the Battery Electric Vehicle
and Hybrid Electric Vehicle that converts electrical energy
into mechanical energy and uses electric power from the
traction of the battery, turning the transmission and the
wheels.


For the purposes of this Policy, it means the original
Electric Motor provided by the Manufacturer along with
new purchase of the Vehicle without any modifications, or
the original Electric Motor that has been replaced by the




original equipment manufacturer following some fortuitous
event.


1.5. **Electric vehicle**


An electric vehicle is a vehicle that uses one or more electric
motors for propulsion. It can be powered by a collector
system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or it
can be powered autonomously by a battery (sometimes
charged by solar panels), or by converting fuel to electricity
using fuel cells or a generator.


Electric Vehicle means either Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or
Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV).


1.6. **Insured Vehicle**


Means the Electric Vehicle and Hybrid Electric Vehicle
defined in section 1.5 and 1.7 respectively. It is alternatively
referred to as simply Vehicle or Electric Vehicle. It includes
standard tools and accessories that are provided by the
Manufacturer of the Vehicle at the time of new purchase of
the Vehicle.

It is identifiable by the Chassis Number and Motor Number
provided by the Manufacturer.


For the purpose of this Policy, only vehicles manufactured
by a recognized Manufacturer, who is a member of the
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (‘SIAM’) are
insurable. Further, such vehicles are certified by Automotive
Research Association of India (‘ARAI’) with regards to the

cannot be plugged in to charge the battery. Instead, the
battery is charged through regenerative braking and by the
internal combustion engine.


Hybrid Electric Vehicle system Means the system that
contains of electric motor, DC/DC step down converter,
electric generator and power electronics controller.


1.8. **State of Health (SOH) of the Lithium-Ion Battery**


Means the measurement of condition of the LithiumIon Battery compared with that of the manufacturer’s
specification for the Lithium-Ion Battery. It is generally
expressed in percentage terms, ranging between 0% to
100%. 100% means that battery’s condition is fully meeting
the manufacturer’s specifications. The typical factors
considered in these calculations are (the list below is
inclusive but not exhaustive):
