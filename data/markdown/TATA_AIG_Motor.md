of NCB for the transferee will be as per transferee’s
eligibility for Private Car policy following the
transfer of interest.


2. Where the insured is an individual, and on his/ her
death the custody and use of the vehicle pass to
his/her spouse and/or children and/or parents, the

to such person/s to whom the custody and use of
the vehicle passes.


3. The percentage of NCB earned on a vehicle
owned by an institution during the period when
it was allotted to and exclusively operated by an
employee shall be passed on to the employee if
the ownership of the vehicle is transferred in the
name of the employee. This will however require
submission of a suitable letter from the employer
confirming that prior to transfer of ownership of
the vehicle to the employee, it was allotted to and
exclusively operated by the employee during the
period in which the NCB was earned.


4. In the event of the insured, transferring his
insurance from one insurer to another insurer, the

transferee insurer shall allow the same rate of NCB

which the insured would have received from the

previous insurer subject to submission of evidence
of the insured’s NCB entitlement either in the form

of a renewal notice or a letter confirming the NCB
entitlement from the previous insurer.


5. Where the insured is unable to produce such
evidence of NCB entitlement from the previous
insurer, the claimed NCB may be permitted after
obtaining from the insured a declaration as per the
following wording:


“I / We declare that the rate of NCB claimed by me/
us is correct and that no claim has arisen in the

expiring period of insurance (copy of the policy
enclosed). I/We further undertake that if this
declaration is found to be incorrect, all benefits
under the policy in respect of Section I of the Policy
will stand forfeited.”



6. If an insured vehicle is sold and not replaced
immediately, NCB, if any, may be granted only on
a subsequent insurance and not any subsisting
insurance, provided such fresh insurance is
effected within 3 (three) years from the date of sale
of insured vehicle. The rate of NCB applicable to
the fresh policy shall be that earned at the expiry
of the last 12 months period of insurance.


7. On production of evidence of having earned NCB
abroad, an insured shall be granted NCB on a
new policy taken out in India as per entitlement
earned abroad, provided the policy is taken out in
India within three years of expiry of the overseas
insurance policy, subject to relevant provisions of
NCB mentioned herein. NCB slab will be allowed

as per table above corresponding to the claim free
years as certified by insurer abroad.


8. Except as provided in Rule 6 and 7, no NCB will be
allowed when a policy is not renewed within 90
days of its expiry.
